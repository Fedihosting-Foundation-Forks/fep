## Merge a FEP

This script prints the issue url, you will need it later to add the
link to the SocialHub discussion. Then run

```bash
python ISSUE_TEMPATE/create_readme.py
```

changes to the FEP (added discussionTo to frontmatter) and REAME.md,

Run

```bash
python ISSUE_TEMPATE/create_topic.py $SLUG
```

and following the instructions to create a topic on SocialHub to discuss
the FEP.

Finally, add the link to the SocialHub issue to the tracking issue, created above.
