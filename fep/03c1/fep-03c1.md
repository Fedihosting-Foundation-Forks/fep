# FEP-03c1: Actors without acct-URI

## Summary

Most current Fediverse applications use an acct-URI as unique display name
for actors. Usually, this display is done by displaying `acct:user@domain.example`
as `@user@domain.example`. This FEP states that if there is no
acct-URI associated with an actor, the actor should be displayed
as its id. So the actor with id `https://actor.example/path` will be
displayed as `https://actor.example/path`.

In addition to the example below, we wish to point out that further independence of webfinger will enable new features such as using domain names as handles.

## Example: RSS

Consider building an application that posts new entries of an RSS
feed to the Fediverse. Let's assume we are interested in the updates
of the [bovine python library](https://pypi.org/project/bovine/)
available through RSS at [https://pypi.org/rss/project/bovine/releases.xml](https://pypi.org/rss/project/bovine/releases.xml).
Then an uri for this actor might look like

```url
https://rss.example/actor?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fpypi.org%2Frss%2Fproject%2Fbovine%2Freleases.xml
```

This would enable `rss.example` to automatically generate the respective actor and generate an actor object like

```json
{
    "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    "id": "https://rss.example/actor?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fpypi.org%2Frss%2Fproject%2Fbovine%2Freleases.xml",
    "type": "Service",
    "inbox": "https://rss.example/inbox?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fpypi.org%2Frss%2Fproject%2Fbovine%2Freleases.xml",
    "outbox": "https://rss.example/outbox?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fpypi.org%2Frss%2Fproject%2Fbovine%2Freleases.xml",
    "followers": "https://rss.example/followers?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fpypi.org%2Frss%2Fproject%2Fbovine%2Freleases.xml",
    "name": "PyPI recent updates for bovine",
    "url": "https://pypi.org/project/bovine/",
    "summary": "Recent updates to the Python Package Index for bovine"
}
```

There is now no obvious choice for `preferredUsername` and thus acct-URI.
If one wanted to create one, the best choice would probably be to hash the url of the feed. This unfortunately has the consequence of not generating a human readable id, but quite the opposite.
