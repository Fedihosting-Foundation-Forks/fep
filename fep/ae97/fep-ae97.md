# FEP-ae97: Client-side activity signing

## Summary

Existing Fediverse servers manage signing keys on behalf of their users. This proposal describes a new kind of [ActivityPub][ActivityPub] client that lets users sign activities with their own keys, and a server that can distribute client-signed activities to other servers.

## History

[Initial version](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/commit/fc9c65daca267be9f91761ed854eac9e829222a2/fep/ae97/fep-ae97.md) of this proposal relied on linking of cryptographic identities to actor objects via [FEP-c390] identity proofs. That mechanism was superseded by [FEP-ef61] which achieves full data portability.

## Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119][RFC-2119].

## Registering an actor

Client creates portable actor objects according to [FEP-ef61] and stores them.

Before registering a portable actor on the server, the client MUST generate an RSA key and attach it to actor object via `publicKey` property, and also add it to the `assertionMethod` array as described in [FEP-521a]. Then it MUST add the server URL to the `gateways` array of the actor object.

To register the actor, the client MUST send an HTTP POST request to the gateway endpoint at `/.well-known/apgateway` path. The body of the request MUST be an actor object. The request MUST have an `X-Rsa-Secret-Key` header containing the previously generated RSA secret key in `secretKeyMultibase` format described in section *2.3.1.2 Multikey* of [Data Integrity](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity/#multikey) specification.

If the server accepts registration request, its response MUST have `201 Created` status code.

## Sending activities

Client submits signed [FEP-ef61] activities to actor's outbox. Contrary to what ActivityPub specification prescribes in section [6. Client to Server Interactions](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#client-to-server-interactions), the server MUST NOT overwrite the ID of activity. Instead of assigning a new ID, the server MUST verify that provided ID has not been used before. If activity ID is in compatible format (HTTP(S) URI), the server MUST check that its [origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin) is the same as the server's origin. If the server accepts activity, its response MUST have `202 Accepted` status code.

If activity contains a wrapped object (as in `Create` and `Update` activities), it MUST be a portable object created according to [FEP-ef61]. The server MUST validate object IDs in the same way it validates activity IDs.

The server MUST deliver activities to their indended audiences without altering them.

## Receiving activities

Client receives activities by polling the actor's inbox.

Requests to inbox endpoint MUST have an HTTP signature created using the RSA secret key generated during registration.
