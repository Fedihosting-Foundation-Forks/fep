# FEP-3264: Federated Work Coordination

## Summary

This document describes an implementation of project planning and work coordination based on [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) protocol and [Valueflows](https://valueflo.ws/) vocabulary. It includes planning what people want to do, and (optionally) recording what is done.

## History

This is a parallel submission to [FEP-c5a1 To-do's](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/fep/c5a1/fep-c5a1.md), which supports much simpler planning. Both planning submissions continue the idea of Valueflows extensions to ActivityPub/ActivityStreams based on use case, started by silverpill with [ FEP-0837 Federated Marketplace](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/fep/0837/fep-0837.md).

## Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119.html).

## Planning a project or some work

This FEP will support work plans or projects of any size, using a Plan with one or more Processes, each with one or more input and/or output Commitments.

Consuming implementations which don't have planning features MAY display plan-related objects similarly to `Note` objects.

In all cases, the objects can also be discussed using `Note` objects and `replyTo`.

Valueflows defines a `Plan` as **a logical collection of processes that constitute a body of scheduled work with defined deliverable(s).**

The representation of a plan is a JSON document with the following properties:

- `id` (REQUIRED): the plan's unique global identifier.
- `type` (REQUIRED): the type of the object SHOULD be `Plan`. If interoperability with other ActivityPub services is desirable, implementers MAY also use object types from [Activity Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#object-types), such as `Note`.
- `attributedTo` (REQUIRED): the actor who published the plan.
- `name` (REQUIRED): the title of the plan.
- `content` (OPTIONAL): the description of the plan. The type of content SHOULD be `text/html`.
- `published` (RECOMMENDED): the date and time at which the plan was published.
- `to` (REQUIRED): the audience of the plan.
- `planIncludes` (REQUIRED): the processes that are part of this plan (see below).

A `Process` is defined as **An activity that changes inputs into outputs, by transforming or transporting economic resource(s).**  Processes that are part of a plan can be part of a series (graph) of processes that produce the final output(s) at the end; and/or they can be unrelated to each other, and produce separate final output(s) for the plan.

The representation of a process is a JSON document with the following properties:

- `id` (REQUIRED): the process's unique global identifier.
- `type` (REQUIRED): the type of the object MUST be `Process`.
- `name` (REQUIRED): an informal or formal textual identifier for a process.
- `hasBeginning` (OPTIONAL): the date and time the process is planned to begin.
- `hasEnd` (OPTIONAL): the date and time the process is planned to end.
- `content` (OPTIONAL): the description of what is to be done in the process. The type of content SHOULD be `text/html`.
- `hasInput` (OPTIONAL): the input commitment(s) of the process (see below).
- `hasOutput` (OPTIONAL): the output commitment(s) of the process (see below).

A `Commitment` is defined as **A planned economic flow that has been promised by an agent to another agent.**

- `id` (REQUIRED): the commitment's unique global identifier.
- `type` (REQUIRED): the type of the object MUST be `Commitment`.
- `action` (REQUIRED): the type of economic transaction. If the commitment is an input, the value of this property SHOULD be one of: `work`, `use`, `consume`, `cite`, `pickup`, `accept`.  It the commitment is an output, the value of this property SHOULD be one of: `produce`, `deliverService`, `dropoff`, `modify`.  See [the action definitions and behaviors](https://www.valueflo.ws/concepts/actions/) for more information.
- `resourceConformsTo` (RECOMMENDED): the type of an economic resource (can be a skill or type of work for the `work` action). Could be any URI.
- `resourceQuantity` (OPTIONAL): the amount and unit of the non-effort-based economic resource.  Either `resourceQuantity` or `effortQuantity` is RECOMMENDED, and both can be included in case of `use`. This is an object with two properties:
  - `hasUnit` (REQUIRED): name of the unit, according to [Ontology of units of Measure](http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/) classification.
  - `hasNumericalValue` (REQUIRED): amount of the resource.
- `effortQuantity` (OPTIONAL): the amount and unit of the work or use effort-based action. This is an object with two properties:
  - `hasUnit` (REQUIRED): name of the unit, according to [Ontology of units of Measure](http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/) classification.
  - `hasNumericalValue` (REQUIRED): amount of the effort.
- `provider` (RECOMMENDED): the actor who commits to providing the resource. If not included, it is assumed to be the `attributedTo` actor.
- `receiver` (RECOMMENDED): the actor who commits to receiving the resource.  If not included, it is assumed to be the `to` actor.
- `content` (OPTIONAL): the description of what is to be done for this commitment. The type of content SHOULD be `text/html`.

}
```

## Accepting a Commitment

The `object` of `Accept` activity MUST be the `id` of the `Commitment` in the `Plan` object previously sent to the actor.

Activity MAY contain `content` property for further coordination.

Example:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Accept",
  "id": "https://project.example/activities/059f08fa-31b1-4136-8d76-5987d705a0ac",
  "actor": "https://project.example/actors/bob",
  "object": "https://project.example/inputs/ddde9d6f-6f3b-4770-a966-3a18ef006931#cider4",
  "content": "I'll come early to help unload the cider press.",
  "to": "https://project.example/actors/alice"
}
```

## Rejecting a Commitment

The `object` of `Reject` activity MUST be the `id` of the `Commitment` in the `Plan` object previously sent to the actor.

Activity MAY contain `content` property indicating the reason for rejection.

Example:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Reject",
  "id": "https://project.example/activities/8c05f97f-1531-4b70-9ca8-4ee4a09f36a4",
  "actor": "https://project.example/actors/chiam",
  "object": "https://project.example/inputs/ddde9d6f-6f3b-4770-a966-3a18ef006931#cider3",
  "content": "Sorry, already working elsewhere that day, will check with Eleanore.",
  "to": "https://project.example/actors/alice"
}
```

## Adding a Commitment to the Plan

In some cases, an actor might want to add a new commitment to the plan.

The representation of a commitment is a JSON document with the following properties:

- `id` (REQUIRED): the commitment's unique global identifier.
- `type` (REQUIRED): the type of the object SHOULD be `Commitment`. If interoperability with other ActivityPub services is desirable, implementers MAY also use object types from [Activity Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#object-types), such as `Note`.
- `attributedTo` (REQUIRED): the actor who published the commitment.
- `content` (OPTIONAL): the description of the commitment or communication about the commitment. The type of content SHOULD be `text/html`.
- `published` (RECOMMENDED): the date and time at which the commitment was published.
- `to` (REQUIRED): the audience of the commitment.
- `action` (REQUIRED): the type of economic transaction. If the commitment is an input, the value of this property SHOULD be one of: `work`, `use`, `consume`, `cite`, `pickup`, `accept`.  It the commitment is an output, the value of this property SHOULD be one of: `produce`, `deliverService`, `dropoff`, `modify`.  See [the action definitions and behaviors](https://www.valueflo.ws/concepts/actions/) for more information.
- `inputOf`: the process for which this commitment is an input.  Either `inputOf` or `outputOf` is REQUIRED.
- `outputOf`: the process for which this commitment is an output.  Either `inputOf` or `outputOf` is REQUIRED.
- `context` (OPTIONAL): the plan the commitment is part of.
- `resourceConformsTo` (RECOMMENDED): the type of an economic resource (can be a skill or type of work for the `work` action). Could be any URI.
- `resourceQuantity`: the amount and unit of the non-effort-based economic resource.  Either `resourceQuantity` or `effortQuantity` is RECOMMENDED, and both can be included in case of `use`. This is an object with two properties:
  - `hasUnit` (REQUIRED): name of the unit, according to [Ontology of units of Measure](http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/) classification.
  - `hasNumericalValue` (REQUIRED): amount of the resource.
- `effortQuantity`: the amount and unit of the work or use effort-based action.  Either `resourceQuantity` or `effortQuantity` is RECOMMENDED, and both can be included in case of `use`. This is an object with two properties:
  - `hasUnit` (REQUIRED): name of the unit, according to [Ontology of units of Measure](http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/) classification.
  - `hasNumericalValue` (REQUIRED): amount of the resource.
- `provider` (RECOMMENDED): the actor who commits to providing the resource. If not included, it is assumed to be the `attributedTo` actor.
- `receiver` (RECOMMENDED): the actor who commits to receiving the resource.  If not included, it is assumed to be the `to` actor.

}
```

## Recording what actually was done

Actual economic activity is represented with EconomicEvents in Valueflows.  Economic events can be recorded as fulfilling a planned commitment, or by themselves if they were not explicitly planned.  In either case, in the scope of this FEP, they are also inputs or outputs of a process.

This FEP does *not* include creating and updating of actual resource inventory, which is also effected through economic events.

The representation of an economic event is a JSON document with the following properties:

- `id` (REQUIRED): the economic event's unique global identifier.
- `type` (REQUIRED): the type of the object SHOULD be `EconomicEvent`. If interoperability with other ActivityPub services is desirable, implementers MAY also use object types from [Activity Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#object-types), such as `Note`.
- `attributedTo` (REQUIRED): the actor who published the economic event.
- `content` (OPTIONAL): the description of the economic event or communication about the economic event. The type of content SHOULD be `text/html`.
- `published` (RECOMMENDED): the date and time at which the economic event was published.
- `to` (REQUIRED): the audience of the economic event.
- `action` (REQUIRED): the type of economic transaction. If the economic event is an input, the value of this property SHOULD be one of: `work`, `use`, `consume`, `cite`, `pickup`, `accept`.  It the economic event is an output, the value of this property SHOULD be one of: `produce`, `deliverService`, `dropoff`, `modify`.  See [the action definitions and behaviors](https://www.valueflo.ws/concepts/actions/) for more information.
- `fulfills`: the commitment the economic event is completely or partially fulfilling, REQUIRED if there is sucn a commitment, otherwise N/A.
- `inputOf`: the process for which this economic event is an input.  Either `inputOf` or `outputOf` is REQUIRED.
- `outputOf`: the process for which this commitment is an output.  Either `inputOf` or `outputOf` is REQUIRED.
- `context` (OPTIONAL): the plan the economic event is part of.
- `resourceConformsTo` (RECOMMENDED): the type of an economic resource (can be a skill or type of work for the `work` action). Could be any URI.
- `resourceQuantity`: the amount and unit of the non-effort-based economic resource.  Either `resourceQuantity` or `effortQuantity` is RECOMMENDED, and both can be included in case of `use`. This is an object with two properties:
  - `hasUnit` (REQUIRED): name of the unit, according to [Ontology of units of Measure](http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/) classification.
  - `hasNumericalValue` (REQUIRED): amount of the resource.
- `effortQuantity`: the amount and unit of the work or use effort-based action.  Either `resourceQuantity` or `effortQuantity` is RECOMMENDED, and both can be included in case of `use`. This is an object with two properties:
  - `hasUnit` (REQUIRED): name of the unit, according to [Ontology of units of Measure](http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/) classification.
  - `hasNumericalValue` (REQUIRED): amount of the resource.
- `provider` (RECOMMENDED): the actor who provided the resource. If not included, it is assumed to be the `attributedTo` actor.
- `receiver` (RECOMMENDED): the actor who received the resource.  If not included, it is assumed to be the `to` actor.
- `finished` (OPTIONAL): set to true if this economic event completes the commitment. (Note more than one economic event can be recorded against the same commitment.)
