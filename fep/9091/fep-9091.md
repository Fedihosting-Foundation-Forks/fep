# FEP-9091: Export Actor Service Endpoint

## Summary

This FEP defines an API endpoint used to initiate the "Export Actor" operation.
The output and semantics of the _result_ of the export operation is out of scope, and left
to subsequent FEPs.
The endpoint only specifies how to _start_ the operation, and by extension, how to tell if
a given Actor's server supports this operation.

### Example Actor Profile with Export Service Endpoint

```js
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"
  ],
  "id": "https://alice-personal-site.example/actor",
  "type": "Person",
  "name": "Alice",
  "service": [{
     "id": "https://alice-personal-site.example/actor#export",
     "serviceEndpoint": "https://alice-personal-site.example/actor/accountExport"
  }]
}
```

## Initiating the Export Actor Operation

If a client conforming to this FEP wishes to start the 'Export Actor' process, such as to
create a backup of the Actor profile, its private key material, and all content associated
with this actor, the client MUST perform the following steps:

1. Fetch the Actor profile object.
2. Locate the `service` description object with an `id` ending in `#export`.
3. Locate the corresponding `serviceEndpoint` URL, in that description object.

    * If no such service description item exists, this means that the server hosting the
      Actor's profile does not support this operation.

4. The client makes an HTTP `POST` to the URL in the `serviceEndpoint` to initiate the
   export operation.

    * The client MUST include appropriate authorization credentials that indicate that
      it is authorized to perform this operation (that it's authorized to receive the
      highly private result of account export). The exact format of these authorization
      credentials is out of scope of this FEP.
