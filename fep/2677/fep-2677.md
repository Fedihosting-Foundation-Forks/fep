# FEP-2677: Identifying the Application Actor

## Summary

It is a common pattern in Fediverse applications to have a special
actor of type `Application`. This is for example the actor at `https://mastodon.example/actor`
for Mastodon or at `https://pleroma.example/internal/fetch` for Pleroma.
This application actor can be fetched with an unsigned request, so it
is possible to use it to fetch public keys.

The goal of this FEP is to provide an explicit mechanism of identifying
the application actor, with the goal of making it usable for further tasks,
e.g.

- Allowing for application to application communication by having
application actor send activities to another application actor's inbox.
- Having an object one can attach further information to. This means, one
could attach a list of implemented FEPs to the application actor.

## Requirements

### Application Actor

We will first define, what we mean by an _application actor_. We will impose two
requirements on them

1. It's an [ActivityPub] Actor of type [Application](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-application).
2. It can be retrieved without authentication, e.g. with an unsigned HTTP request.

As already mentioned application actors are currently used by most Fediverse
applications to fetch public keys. See [here](#currently-implemented-application-actors) for a list of examples.

### Identifying the Application Actor with nodeinfo

In [NodeInfo], see also [FEP-f1d5], the well-known path `/.well-known/nodeinfo` is defined and it is specified that a document in JRD format [RFC 7033] is served there.

The requirement of the current FEP is that the `/.well-known/nodeinfo` contains an additional link with
relation type `https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Application`,
which resolves to an application actor as described in the previous section.

We note that it is not necessary to implement the relations specified in [NodeInfo] to satisfy the current FEP.

## Example

We will consider the server with domain `node.example`. This means that a request
to `https://node.example/.well-known/nodeinfo` will resolve to

```json
 {
    "links": [
        {
            "rel": "http://nodeinfo.diaspora.software/ns/schema/2.0",
            "href": "https://node.example/nodeinfo/2.0"
        },
        {
            "rel": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Application",
            "href": "https://node.example/actor"
        }
    ]
 }
```

Next, a request to `https://node.example/actor` with accept header `application/activity+json`
could return

```json
{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
        "https://w3id.org/security/v1",
    ],
    "id": "https://node.example/actor",
    "type": "Application",
    "inbox": "https://node.example/actor/inbox",
    "outbox": "https://node.example/actor/outbox",
    "publicKey": {
        "id": "https://node.example/actor#main-key",
        "owner": "https://node.example/actor",
        "publicKeyPem": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n....\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n"
    }
}
```

## Discussion

The approach of this FEP has been chosen to have a light touch. Some alternative choices would be:

1. A fixed path for the application actor
2. A fixed path for application information instead of aiming to attach it to the application actor.

Both options have the downside that it would require to introduce a new path, which forces every implementation to implement it in a similar way. Instead, we reuse an existing path, and the implementer is free to choose where to put the application actor.

---

The second question is why fix the type `Application` and not `Service`. First, it is consistent with most current implementations. Second, Mastodon uses `Service` for bot accounts. So it feels like a good idea to start distinguishing from this usage. We would phrase this distinction as follows:

- An actor of type `Application` is triggered by events in the application, e.g. a signed request and then fetching the corresponding public key.
- An actor of type `Service` is triggered by either activities arriving at its inbox or external events, e.g. a timer. This means an actor of type `Service` is similar to one controlled by an user.

These are not hard rules on when to use `Application` or `Service`. They will probably break down as more complicated Fediverse implementations are build. We hope that they can serve as a level of guidance, how to differentiate actors.
