# FEP-7628: Move actor

## Summary

Migration of social graph from one [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) server to another.

## History

`Move` activity is defined in [Activity Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-move).

Mastodon started using [`Move`](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/activitypub/#Move) activity for migrating accounts [in 2019](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/11846). The activity is sent by the old server to actor's followers and actors who receive this activity un-follow the old account and follow the new account.

`Move` activity is used in [Streams](https://codeberg.org/streams/streams/src/commit/06a702873f3151f6b01dce9d19fd261473f3e3d8/FEDERATION.md?display=source#L52-L57) as a part of [Nomadic Identity](https://codeberg.org/streams/streams/src/commit/06a702873f3151f6b01dce9d19fd261473f3e3d8/spec/Nomad/Nomadic%20Identity.md) mechanism.

## Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119.html).

## Linked actors

One persona can be represented by one or more actors. Different actors are considered associated with one persona if they are **linked**. Possible ways to link actors:

- `alsoKnownAs` property of an actor object. This method is used by [Mastodon](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/#aliases).
- [FEP-c390](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/fep/c390/fep-c390.md) identity proofs. Actors are linked if they have identity proofs with the same `subject` property.
- [rel-me](https://indieweb.org/rel-me) links. Actors are linked if their profile metadata contains verified rel-me links pointing to the same website.

## Migration

Among actors associated with a persona, there MUST be one **primary** actor. **Migration** of an account means the change of a primary actor.

## Move activity

`Move` activity is used to notify other actors about the migration. It MUST have the following properties:

- `type`: the type of activity must be `Move`.
- `actor`: the actor performing the migration.
- `object`: the old primary actor ID.
- `target`: the new primary actor ID.

The activity is considered valid if `object` and `target` actors are linked.

Upon receiving valid `Move` activity, all actors following `object` MAY un-follow it by sending `Undo(Follow)` activity and MUST either send `Follow` activity to the `target` or otherwise notify the user that their contact has moved.

This activity comes in two sub-types:

1. `Move` sent by the old actor. In this case, the old server needs to be online.
2. `Move` sent by the new actor. In this case, the old server doesn't need to be online, but the person using the actor SHOULD have a reserve copy of the follower list.

Example (activity subtype 1):

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://server1.example/activities/9b496346-fa69-40ac-bc4e-7ac06192abe1",
  "type": "Move",
  "actor": "https://server1.example/users/alice",
  "object": "https://server1.example/users/alice",
  "target": "https://server2.example/users/alice",
  "to": "https://server1.example/users/alice/followers"
}
```

Example (activity subtype 2):

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://server2.example/activities/9b496346-fa69-40ac-bc4e-7ac06192abe1",
  "type": "Move",
  "actor": "https://server2.example/users/alice",
  "object": "https://server1.example/users/alice",
  "target": "https://server2.example/users/alice",
  "to": "https://server2.example/users/alice/followers"
}
```

## `movedTo` and `copiedTo` properties

If previous primary actor is deactivated after migration, it MUST have `movedTo` property containing the ID of the new primary actor. Publishers SHOULD NOT deliver activities to actor's inbox if `movedTo` property is present.

If it is not deactivated, `copiedTo` property MUST be used.
