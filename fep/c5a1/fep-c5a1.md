# FEP-c5a1: To-do's

## Summary

This document describes an implementation of simple to-do's or tasks based on [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) protocol and [Valueflows](https://valueflo.ws/) vocabulary.  A to-do is a simple work commitment, and can be created for oneself or another person. Optionally, when the to-do is done, that can be recorded also.

## History

This is a parallel submission to [FEP-3264 Federated Work Coordination](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/fep/3264/fep-3264.md), which supports much more complex project or production planning. Both planning submissions continue the idea of Valueflows extensions to ActivityPub/ActivityStreams based on use case, started by silverpill with [ FEP-0837 Federated Marketplace](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/fep/0837/fep-0837.md).

## Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119.html).

## Creating a to-do

A to-do is implemented as a Valueflows `Commitment`.

Consuming implementations which don't have planning features MAY display plan-related objects similarly to `Note` objects.

In all cases, the objects can also be discussed using `Note` objects and `replyTo`.

Valueflows defines a commitment is defined as **A planned economic flow that has been promised by an agent to another agent.**

- `id` (REQUIRED): the commitment's unique global identifier.
- `type` (REQUIRED): the type of the object MUST be `Commitment`.
- `attributedTo` (REQUIRED): the actor who published the commitment.
- `published` (RECOMMENDED): the date and time at which the commitment was published.
- `resourceConformsTo` (OPTIONAL): the skill or type of work involved. Could be any URI.
- `effortQuantity` (OPTIONAL): the estimated or expected amount and unit of the work. This is an object with two properties:
  - `hasUnit` (REQUIRED): name of the unit, according to [Ontology of units of Measure](http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/) classification.
  - `hasNumericalValue` (REQUIRED): amount of the resource.
- `provider` (RECOMMENDED): the actor who commits to providing the resource, including doing the work.  If not included, it is assumed to be the `to` actor.
- `receiver` (RECOMMENDED): the actor who will be receiving the resource.  If not included, it is assumed to be the `attributedTo` actor.
- `content` (RECOMMENDED): the description of what is to be done. The type of content SHOULD be `text/html`.
- `to` (REQUIRED): the audience of the commitment.

Example:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {
      "om2": "http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/",

      "effortQuantity": "vf:effortQuantity",
      "hasUnit": "om2:hasUnit",
      "hasNumericalValue": "om2:hasNumericalValue"
    }
  ],

    "receiver": "https://project.example/actors/alice"
  },
  "to": "https://project.example/actors/bob"
}
```

## Accepting a To-do

Accepting or rejecting a to-do is OPTIONAL for this FEP, although it may be required based on the understanding between the actors.

The `object` of `Accept` activity MUST be the `id` of the `Commitment` object previously sent to the actor.

Activity MAY contain `content` property for further coordination.

Example:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Accept",
  "id": "https://project.example/todos/ddde9d6f-6f3b-4770-a966-9kh93jcmljei",
  "actor": "https://project.example/actors/bob",
  "object": "https://project.example/todos/ddde9d6f-6f3b-4770-a966-4dkjh8w32e59",
  "content": "Should be done within a couple days.",
  "to": "https://project.example/actors/alice"
}
```

## Rejecting a To-do

Accepting or rejecting a to-do is OPTIONAL for this FEP, although it may be required based on the understanding between the actors.

The `object` of `Reject` activity MUST be the `id` of the `Commitment` object previously sent to the actor.

Activity MAY contain `content` property indicating the reason for rejection.

Example:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Reject",
  "id": "https://project.example/todos/8c05f97f-1531-4b70-9ca8-4ee4a09f36a3",
  "actor": "https://project.example/actors/bob",
  "object": "https://project.example/todos/ddde9d6f-6f3b-4770-a966-4dkjh8w32e59",
  "content": "Sorry, my schedule is full for a month.",
  "to": "https://project.example/actors/alice"
}
```

## Recording what actually was done

Recording what was done is OPTIONAL for the FEP, although it may be required by the actors involved.

Actual economic activity is represented with an `EconomicEvent` in Valueflows.  In the case of to-do's, it would only occur in response to an earlier to-do commitment.  More than one `EconomicEvent` can be recorded for one `Commitment` to-do.

The representation of an economic event is a JSON document with the following properties:

- `id` (REQUIRED): the economic event's unique global identifier.
- `type` (REQUIRED): the type of the object SHOULD be `EconomicEvent`. If interoperability with other ActivityPub services is desirable, implementers MAY also use object types from [Activity Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#object-types), such as `Note`.
- `attributedTo` (REQUIRED): the actor who published the economic event.
- `content` (OPTIONAL): the description of the economic event or communication about the economic event. The type of content SHOULD be `text/html`.
- `published` (RECOMMENDED): the date and time at which the economic event was published.
- `to` (REQUIRED): the audience of the economic event.
- `fulfills` (REQUIRED): the commitment the economic event is completely or partially fulfilling.
- `resourceConformsTo` (OPTIONAL): the type of an economic resource (for to-do's, can be a skill or type of work). Could be any URI.  It does not have to match the commitment, but if not included, can be assumed it is the same.
- `effortQuantity` (OPTIONAL): the amount and unit of the work done (for to-do's, usually a time quantity). This is an object with two properties:
  - `hasUnit` (REQUIRED): name of the unit, according to [Ontology of units of Measure](http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/) classification.
  - `hasNumericalValue` (REQUIRED): amount of the resource.
- `provider` (RECOMMENDED): the actor who commits to doing the work.  If not included, it is assumed to be the `attributedTo` actor.
- `receiver` (RECOMMENDED): the actor who will be receiving the benefit.  If not included, it is assumed to be the `to` actor.
- `finished` (OPTIONAL): set to true if this economic event completes the commitment, or the commitment is no longer open for some reason.

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {
      "om2": "http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/",
      "vf": "https://w3id.org/valueflows/ont/vf#",
      "EconomicEvent": "vf:EconomicEvent",
      "fulfills": "vf:fulfills",
      "receiver": "vf:receiver",
      "provider": "vf:provider",
      "resourceConformsTo": "vf:resourceConformsTo",
      "effortQuantity": "vf:effortQuantity",
      "hasUnit": "om2:hasUnit",
      "hasNumericalValue": "om2:hasNumericalValue",
      "finished": "vf:finished"
    }
  ],
  "type": "Create",
  "id": "https://project.example/activities/ad2f7ee1-6567-413e-a10b-72650cbdc932/create",
  "actor": "https://project.example/actors/bob",
  "object": {
    "type": "EconomicEvent",
    "id": "https://project.example/inputs/ad2f7ee1-6567-413e-a10b-72650cbdc932",
    "attributedTo": "https://project.example/actors/bob",
    "published": "2024-10-21T14:16:41.843794Z",
    "fulfills": "https://project.example/todos/ddde9d6f-6f3b-4770-a966-4dkjh8w32e59",
    "resourceConformsTo": "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3485549",
    "effortQuantity": {
      "hasUnit": "hour",
      "hasNumericalValue": "1.5"
    },
    "provider": "https://project.example/actors/bob",
    "receiver": "https://project.example/actors/alice",
    "finished": true
  },
  "to": "https://project.example/actors/alice"
}
```

The `Commitment` can alternatively be marked as `finished`, without recording an `EconomicEvent`.  This could occur in cases where no work will be done, or work was done but will not be recorded, or some work was recorded earlier without marking the to-do `finished`.  So, `finished` does not imply that the to-do was done, only that it is not waiting to be done any more.

{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {
      "om2": "http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/",
      "vf": "https://w3id.org/valueflows/ont/vf#",
      "Commitment": "vf:Commitment",
      "finished": "vf:finished"
    }
  ],

    "finished": true
  },
  "to": "https://project.example/actors/alice"
}
```
