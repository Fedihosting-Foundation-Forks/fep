# FEP-1970: Chat Links

## Summary

This FEP describes a way to attach a chat room to [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) actors and objects.
The chat room itself can be a web page, a XMPP room, a Matrix room, an IRC channel, ... The chat itself does not necessarily publish messages using ActivityPub.

## Chat links

Chat link is an object with the following properties:

- `type` (REQUIRED): the type MUST be `Link`.
- `name` (RECOMMENDED): the `name` property SHOULD contain a human-readable description of the chat link.
- `href` (REQUIRED): the `href` property MUST contain a chat URI. This can be an URL of a website, or any other kind of [URI](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc3986), such as a [XMPP uri](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc5122/).
- `rel` (REQUIRED):  the `rel` property MUST contain the string `discussion` or an array containing that string. The `discussion` relation type is proposed as a [HTML5 link type extensions](https://microformats.org/wiki/rel-discussion).

Chat links MUST be added to the `attachment` array of an actor or an object.

## Examples

### Basic object attachment

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Article",
  "id": "https://example.tld/video/123",
  "attributedTo": "https://example.tld/users/alice",
  "name": "Let's go live!",
  "attachment": [
    {
      "type": "Link",
      "name": "Chat",
      "href": "https://example.tld/chat/room/123",
      "rel": "discussion"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Basic actor attachment

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Person",
  "id": "https://example.tld/users/alice",
  "inbox": "https://example.tld/users/alice/inbox",
  "outbox": "https://example.tld/users/alice/outbox",
  "attachment": [
    {
      "type": "Link",
      "name": "Chat",
      "href": "https://example.tld/chat/room/123",
      "rel": "discussion"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Multiple way to join the chat

In the following example, the chat room can be joined using a web browser or a xmpp client:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Video",
  "id": "https://example.tld/video/123",
  "attributedTo": "https://example.tld/users/alice",
  "name": "Let's go live!",
  "attachment": [
    {
      "type": "Link",
      "name": "Chat",
      "href": "https://example.tld/chat/room/123",
      "rel": "discussion"
    },
    {
      "type": "Link",
      "name": "Chat",
      "href": "xmpp://123@room.example.tld?join",
      "rel": "discussion"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Live video stream

For a live stream, represented by a [Video](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-video) object, the chat link could link to the room where viewers can interract with the streamer.

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Video",
  "id": "https://example.tld/video/123",
  "attributedTo": "https://example.tld/users/alice",
  "name": "Let's go live!",
  "attachment": [
    {
      "type": "Link",
      "name": "Chat",
      "href": "https://example.tld/chat/room/123",
      "rel": "discussion"
    }
  ]
}
```

If the chat room is unique per streamer (and common to all the streamer videos), it can be attached to both the Video and the [Person](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-person) object.

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Person",
  "id": "https://example.tld/users/alice",
  "following": "https://example.tld/users/alice/following",
  "followers": "https://example.tld/users/alice/followers",
  "name": "Alice",
  "attachment": [
    {
      "type": "Link",
      "name": "Chat",
      "href": "https://example.tld/chat/room/123",
      "rel": "discussion"
    }
  ]
}

{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Video",
  "id": "https://example.tld/video/123",
  "attributedTo": "https://example.tld/users/alice",
  "name": "Let's go live!",
  "attachment": [
    {
      "type": "Link",
      "name": "Chat",
      "href": "https://example.tld/chat/room/123",
      "rel": "discussion"
    }
  ]
}
```

If the chat room is unique to a streamer's channel, it can be linked to both the Video and the [Group](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-group) object.

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Group",
  "id": "https://example.tld/channel/alice",
  "following": "https://example.tld/users/alice/following",
  "followers": "https://example.tld/users/alice/followers",
  "name": "Alice channel",
  "attachment": [
    {
      "type": "Link",
      "name": "Chat",
      "href": "https://example.tld/chat/room/123",
      "rel": "discussion"
    }
  ]
}

{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Video",
  "id": "https://example.tld/video/123",
  "attributedTo": "https://example.tld/users/alice",
  "name": "Let's go live!",
  "attachment": [
    {
      "type": "Link",
      "name": "Chat",
      "href": "https://example.tld/chat/room/123",
      "rel": "discussion"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Document discussion

Some file sharing sofwares allows to have a discussion room attached to files. In such case, the chat links can be added as attachment to [Document](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-document) objects.

### Person instant messaging

If a user has instant messaging applications, chat links could be added to its [Person](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-person) object, so that we can join him.

If the user has multiple instant messaging accounts (XMPP, Matrix, ...), each on of them can be added, and differenciated by the URI scheme.
