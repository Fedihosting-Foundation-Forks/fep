# FEP-9988: Federated Forums

## Summary

This FEP defines UX guidelines for federating topics between forums. Current federation strategies have various shortcomings, incorrect semantics, and overloaded assumptions when it comes to the forum use-case. 

## Glossary

forum
: A central hub of discussion

post
: An article of discussion

user
: Someone who makes posts

topic
: A collection of posts grouped by a common title and/or subject

category
: A collection of topics grouped by a common title and/or subject

## UX considerations

The following features should be supported:
- Following a user
- Following a topic
- Following a category
- Placing topics within categories
- Placing categories within a hierarchy of categories
- Moving posts to other topics
- Moving topics to other categories
- Moving categories to a different place in the hierarchy of categories
- 

## Data model

From the [AS2-Core] specification, this FEP makes use of the Collection mechanism for representing topics and categories. This makes topic management explicit via `Add` and `Remove` activities. The topic is specified by the `context` property, and usage of the `context` property is clarified further in [FEP-7888].

### Properties used

#### Users

#### Posts

`name`
: (Optional) The title of a forum post

`content`
: The text content of the forum post

`context`
: The topic that contains the forum post. Usage of `context` is clarified further in [FEP-7888].

#### Topics

`name`
: The title of a forum topic

`context`
: The category that contains the forum topic.

#### Categories

## Example flows

(This section is non-normative.)

### AS2 consumers

An [AS2-Core] consumer encountering a post can navigate to the topic by dereferencing the `context.id`:

```json
{
	"@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
	"id": "https://example.com/some-object",
	"content": "First post.",
	"context": "https://example.com/some-topic"
}
```

This gives us the following:

```json
{
	"@context": [
		"https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
		{
			"Topic": "https://w3id.org/fep/9988/Topic"
		}
	],
	"id": "https://example.com/some-topic",
	"context": "https://example.com/some-category",
	"type": ["Topic", "OrderedCollection"],
	"attributedTo": "https://example.com/some-topic-moderator",
	"totalItems": 21,
	"first": "https://example.com/some-topic/?start=0&window=10",
	"current": "https://example.com/some-topic/?start=11&window=10"
}
```

We can now browse the `first` page (containing the first 10 posts, from 1 to 10) or the `current` page (containing the most recent 10 posts, from 12 to 21). Alternatively, we can browse the `context` to go up a level in the forum hierarchy.

### AP participants

An [AP] actor can Create a Note and address it to the topic owner, specified by `context.attributedTo`.
