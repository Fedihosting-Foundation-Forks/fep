# FEP-0837: Federated Marketplace

## Summary

This document describes a minimal implementation of a federated marketplace based on [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) protocol and [Valueflows](https://valueflo.ws/) vocabulary. In such marketplace actors can publish offers and requests, respond to offers and requests published by other actors, enter into agreements and exchange information necessary to complete these agreements.

## History

Extension of ActivityPub protocol with Valueflows vocabulary was initially proposed by Lynn Foster in [FEP-d767](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/fep/d767/fep-d767.md).

## Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119.html).

## Proposals

Valueflows defines proposals as **published requests or offers, sometimes with what is expected in return**.

The representation of a proposal is a JSON document with the following properties:

- `id` (REQUIRED): the proposal's unique global identifier.
- `type` (REQUIRED): the type of the object SHOULD be `Proposal`. If interoperability with other ActivityPub services is desirable, implementers MAY use object types from [Activity Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#object-types), such as `Note`.
- `attributedTo` (REQUIRED): the actor who published the proposal.
- `name` (RECOMMENDED): the title of the proposal.
- `content` (OPTIONAL): the description of the proposal. The type of content SHOULD be `text/html`.
- `published` (RECOMMENDED): the date and time at which the proposal was published.
- `location` (OPTIONAL): indicates a physical location associated with the proposal. The representation of location MUST conform to the recommendations of [Activity Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#places) document, section *5.3 Representing Places*.
- `publishes` (REQUIRED): the primary intent of this proposal (see below).
- `reciprocal` (OPTIONAL): the reciprocal intent of this proposal (see below).
- `unitBased` (REQUIRED): indicates whether the quantities expressed in the proposal can be multiplied or not.
- `to` (REQUIRED): the audience of the proposal.

**Intents** are proposed economic transactions. The **primary intent** describes what is being offered or requested, and **reciprocal intent** describes what is expected or offered in return. Some examples:

- A good is offered in exchange for money.
- A good is offered as a gift (no reciprocal intent).
- Service is requested in exchange for money.

The representation of an intent is a JSON document with the following properties:

- `id` (REQUIRED): the unique global identifier of the intent. Implementations SHOULD use URL fragments to identify intents associated with a given proposal. The RECOMMENDED fragment identifiers for primary and reciprocal intents are `primary` and `reciprocal`.
- `type` (REQUIRED): the type of the object MUST be `Intent`.
- `action` (REQUIRED): the type of economic transaction. The value of this property SHOULD be either `deliverService` or `transfer`.
- `resourceConformsTo` (RECOMMENDED): the type of an economic resource. Could be any URI.
- `resourceQuantity` (REQUIRED): the amount and unit of the economic resource. This is an object with two properties:
  - `hasUnit` (REQUIRED): name of the unit, according to [Ontology of units of Measure](http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/) classification. The RECOMMENDED unit for countable items is `one`.
  - `hasNumericalValue` (REQUIRED): amount of the resource.
- `availableQuantity` (OPTIONAL): the quantity of the offered resource currently available.
- `provider`: the actor who provides the resource. This property is REQUIRED for offered resources. If used in primary intent, the value of this property MUST match the value of `attributedTo` property.
- `receiver`: the actor who receives the resource. This property is REQUIRED for requested resources. If used in primary intent, the value of this property MUST match the value of `attributedTo` property.

  },
  "unitBased": false,

}
```

### Publishing a proposal

Proposals can be linked to actors (if actor provides a service) or to other objects (if they represent economic resources) using [FEP-0ea0](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/fep/0ea0/fep-0ea0.md) payment links. Proposals can also be added to public collections, or be delivered to actor's followers, or announced by group actors.

If FEP-0ea0 payment link is used, its `href` attribute MUST contain the proposal ID and its `rel` array MUST contain the string `https://w3id.org/valueflows/Proposal`. The value of `mediaType` attribute SHOULD be `application/ld+json; profile="https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams"`.

Example of a proposal attached to an actor via payment link:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Person",
  "id": "https://market.example/users/alice",
  "inbox": "https://market.example/users/alice",
  "outbox": "https://market.example/users/alice",
  "attachment": [
    {
      "type": "Link",
      "name": "Buy a bike",
      "mediaType": "application/ld+json; profile=\"https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams\"",
      "href": "https://market.example/proposals/ddde9d6f-6f3b-4770-a966-3a18ef006930",
      "rel": ["payment", "https://w3id.org/valueflows/Proposal"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Consuming implementations which don't have marketplace features MAY display proposals similarly to `Note` objects.

## Responding to a proposal

**Commitments** are promised economic transactions. The representation of a commitment is a JSON document with the following properties:

- `id` (OPTIONAL): the unique global identifier of the commitment.
- `type` (REQUIRED): the type of the object MUST be `Commitment`.
- `satisfies` (REQUIRED): the reference to the intent.
- `resourceQuantity` (REQUIRED): the amount and unit of the economic resource.

To respond to a proposal, an interested party MUST send a `Commitment` object wrapped in `Offer` activity to the actor indicated by the `attributedTo` property of the proposal. This `Commitment` object MUST reference the primary intent of the proposal. It is transient, therefore `id` MAY be omitted. If the value of `unitBased` property of the proposal is `false`, the amount of resource MUST be equal to the amount specified in the primary intent. Otherwise, the amount MUST be a multiple of the amount specified in the primary intent.

`Offer` activity MUST have `inReplyTo` property indicating a proposal for which this activity is considered a response.

Example:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {
      "om2": "http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/",
      "vf": "https://w3id.org/valueflows/",
      "Commitment": "vf:Commitment",
      "satisfies": "vf:satisfies",
      "resourceQuantity": "vf:resourceQuantity",
      "hasUnit": "om2:hasUnit",
      "hasNumericalValue": "om2:hasNumericalValue"
    }
  ],
  "type": "Offer",
  "id": "https://social.example/objects/fc4af0d2-c3a1-409b-947c-3c5be29f49b0/offer",
  "actor": "https://social.example/users/bob",
  "inReplyTo": "https://market.example/proposals/ddde9d6f-6f3b-4770-a966-3a18ef006930",
  "object": {
    "type": "Commitment",
    "satisfies": "https://market.example/proposals/ddde9d6f-6f3b-4770-a966-3a18ef006930#primary",
    "resourceQuantity": {
      "hasUnit": "one",
      "hasNumericalValue": "1"
    }
  },
  "to": "https://market.example/users/alice"
}
```

## Agreements

After receiving `Offer(Commitment)` activity, the proposing party MUST either commit to action described in the proposal or send a rejection.

In the first case, actor sends `Accept(Offer)` activity back to the interested party.

In the second case, actor sends `Reject(Offer)` activity.

### Accepting a response

The proposing party MUST create an **agreement** that includes commitments corresponding to intents described in the proposal. If a similar agreement between parties already exists, it MAY be updated.

The representation of an agreement is a JSON document with the following properties:

- `id` (REQUIRED): the unique global identifier of the agreement.
- `type` (REQUIRED): the type of the object MUST be `Agreement`.
- `commitments` (REQUIRED): the list of commitments associated with the agreement. The first commitment MUST satisfy the primary intent of the proposal. The second commitment MUST satisfy the reciprocal intent of the proposal.
  - `id` (REQUIRED): the unique global identifier of the commitment. Implementations SHOULD use URL fragments to identify commitments associated with a given agreement. The RECOMMENDED fragment identifiers for commitments satisfying primary and reciprocal intents of the proposal are `primary` and `reciprocal`.
- `url` (OPTIONAL): one or more links to resources associated with the agreement. An example of such resource is unique payment page.

The `object` of `Accept` activity MUST be the `id` of the `Offer` activity previously sent to the actor.

`Accept` activity MUST have the `result` property containing the `Agreement` object. The first commitment of `Agreement` object MUST match the commitment in the `Offer` activity.

Example:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {
      "om2": "http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/",
      "vf": "https://w3id.org/valueflows/",
      "Agreement": "vf:Agreement",
      "commitments": "vf:commitments",
      "Commitment": "vf:Commitment",
      "satisfies": "vf:satisfies",
      "resourceQuantity": "vf:resourceQuantity",
      "hasUnit": "om2:hasUnit",
      "hasNumericalValue": "om2:hasNumericalValue"
    }
  ],
  "type": "Accept",
  "id": "https://market.example/activities/059f08fa-31b1-4136-8d76-5987d705a0ab",
  "actor": "https://market.example/users/alice",
  "object": "https://social.example/objects/fc4af0d2-c3a1-409b-947c-3c5be29f49b0/offer",
  "result": {
    "type": "Agreement",
    "id": "https://market.example/agreements/edc374aa-e580-4a58-9404-f3e8bf8556b2",
    "commitments": [
      {
        "id": "https://market.example/agreements/edc374aa-e580-4a58-9404-f3e8bf8556b2#primary",
        "type": "Commitment",
        "satisfies": "https://market.example/proposals/ddde9d6f-6f3b-4770-a966-3a18ef006930#primary",
        "resourceQuantity": {
          "hasUnit": "one",
          "hasNumericalValue": "1"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": "https://market.example/agreements/edc374aa-e580-4a58-9404-f3e8bf8556b2#reciprocal",
        "type": "Commitment",
        "satisfies": "https://market.example/proposals/ddde9d6f-6f3b-4770-a966-3a18ef006930#reciprocal",
        "resourceQuantity": {
          "hasUnit": "one",
          "hasNumericalValue": "30"
        }
      }
    ],
    "url": {
      "type": "Link",
      "href": "https://pay.example/invoices/7f1f0c81-0108-4c91-9cb1-d38ebccc3aa1",
      "rel": "payment"
    }
  },
  "to": "https://social.example/users/bob"
}
```

### Rejecting a response

The `object` of `Reject` activity MUST be the `id` of the `Offer` activity previously sent to the actor.

Example:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Reject",
  "id": "https://market.example/activities/8c05f97f-1531-4b70-9ca8-4ee4a09f36a4",
  "actor": "https://market.example/users/alice",
  "object": "https://social.example/objects/fc4af0d2-c3a1-409b-947c-3c5be29f49b0/offer",
  "to": "https://social.example/users/bob"
}
```

## Confirmations

Economic transaction happens outside the protocol. When both parties complete their parts of the transaction, the proposing party MUST publish a confirmation.

The type and structure of confirmation activity may vary between different marketplaces, but it MUST contain a reference to the `Agreement` object. The `context` property is RECOMMENDED for this purpose.

Example:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams"
  ],
  "type": "Create",
  "id": "https://market.example/receipts/ad2f7ee1-6567-413e-a10b-72650cbdc743/create",
  "actor": "https://market.example/users/alice",
  "object": {
    "type": "Document",
    "id": "https://market.example/receipts/ad2f7ee1-6567-413e-a10b-72650cbdc743",
    "context": "https://market.example/agreements/edc374aa-e580-4a58-9404-f3e8bf8556b2",
    "published": "2023-07-03T14:13:41.843794Z"
  },
  "to": "https://social.example/users/bob"
}
```
