# FEP-0837: Federated Marketplace

## Summary

This document describes a minimal implementation of a federated marketplace based on [ActivityPub][ActivityPub] protocol and [Valueflows][Valueflows] vocabulary. In such marketplace actors can publish offers and requests, respond to offers and requests published by other actors, enter into agreements and exchange information necessary to complete these agreements.

## History

Extension of ActivityPub protocol with Valueflows vocabulary was initially proposed by Lynn Foster in [FEP-d767][FEP-d767].

## Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119][RFC-2119].

## Overview

```mermaid

  actor Alice
  actor Bob
  Note right of Alice: Alice publishes a Proposal
  Bob ->> Alice: Bob sends Offer(Agreement) activity
  Alice ->> Bob: Alice sends Accept(Agreement) activity
  Note over Alice, Bob: Alice and Bob complete the transaction
  Alice ->> Bob: Alice sends confirmation activity
```

## Proposals

Valueflows defines proposals as **published requests or offers, sometimes with what is expected in return**.

The representation of a proposal is a JSON document with the following properties:

- `id` (REQUIRED): the proposal's unique global identifier.
- `type` (REQUIRED): the type of the object SHOULD be `Proposal`. If interoperability with other ActivityPub services is desirable, implementers MAY use object types from [Activity Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#object-types), such as `Note`.
- `purpose` (REQUIRED): the type of proposal. Possible values are `offer` and `request`.
- `attributedTo` (REQUIRED): the actor who published the proposal.
- `name` (RECOMMENDED): the title of the proposal.
- `content` (OPTIONAL): the description of the proposal. The type of content SHOULD be `text/html`.
- `published` (RECOMMENDED): the date and time at which the proposal was published.
- `location` (OPTIONAL): indicates a physical location associated with the proposal. The representation of location MUST conform to the recommendations of [Activity Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#places) document, section *5.3 Representing Places*.
- `publishes` (REQUIRED): the primary intent of this proposal (see below).
- `reciprocal` (OPTIONAL): the reciprocal intent of this proposal (see below).
- `unitBased` (OPTIONAL): indicates whether the quantities expressed in the proposal can be multiplied or not.
- `to` (REQUIRED): the audience of the proposal.

**Intents** are proposed economic transactions. The **primary intent** describes what is being offered or requested, and **reciprocal intent** describes what is expected or offered in return. Some examples:

- A good is offered in exchange for money. Transfer of a good is a primary intent and a money transfer is a reciprocal intent.
- A good is offered as a gift. Transfer of a good is a primary intent and there's no reciprocal intent.
- Service is requested in exchange for money. Delivery of a service is a primary intent and money transfer is a reciprocal intent.

The representation of an intent is a JSON document with the following properties:

- `id` (REQUIRED): the unique global identifier of the intent. Implementations SHOULD use URL fragments to identify intents associated with a given proposal. The RECOMMENDED fragment identifiers for primary and reciprocal intents are `primary` and `reciprocal`.
- `type` (REQUIRED): the type of the object MUST be `Intent`.
- `action` (REQUIRED): the type of economic transaction. The value of this property SHOULD be either `deliverService` or `transfer`.
- `resourceConformsTo` (RECOMMENDED): the type of an economic resource. Could be any URI.
- `resourceQuantity` (REQUIRED): the amount and unit of the economic resource. This is an object with two properties:
  - `hasUnit` (REQUIRED): name of the unit, according to [Ontology of units of Measure][OntologyOfUnits] classification. The RECOMMENDED unit for countable items is `one`.
  - `hasNumericalValue` (OPTIONAL): the amount of the resource. If not specified, arbitrary amounts can be used when responding to the proposal.
- `availableQuantity` (OPTIONAL): the quantity of the offered resource currently available.

Minimal example:

}
```

### Publishing a proposal

Proposals can be linked to actors (if actor provides a service) or to other objects (if they represent economic resources) using [FEP-0ea0][FEP-0ea0] payment links. Proposals can also be added to public collections, or be delivered to actor's followers using `Create` activity, or announced by group actors.

If FEP-0ea0 payment link is used, its `href` attribute MUST contain the proposal ID and its `rel` array MUST contain the string `https://w3id.org/valueflows/ont/vf#Proposal`. The value of `mediaType` attribute SHOULD be `application/ld+json; profile="https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams"`.

Example of a proposal attached to an actor via payment link:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Person",
  "id": "https://market.example/users/alice",
  "inbox": "https://market.example/users/alice",
  "outbox": "https://market.example/users/alice",
  "attachment": [
    {
      "type": "Link",
      "name": "Buy a bike",
      "mediaType": "application/ld+json; profile=\"https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams\"",
      "href": "https://market.example/proposals/ddde9d6f-6f3b-4770-a966-3a18ef006930",
      "rel": ["payment", "https://w3id.org/valueflows/ont/vf#Proposal"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Consuming implementations which don't have marketplace features MAY display proposals similarly to `Note` objects.

## Responding to a proposal

### Agreements

An interested party responds to a proposal and then parties start negotiating to reach an **agreement**.

To respond to a proposal, an interested party MUST send an `Agreement` object wrapped in `Offer` activity to the actor indicated by the `attributedTo` property of the proposal. The proposing party MUST either commit to the action described in the proposal or send a rejection.

In the first case, the proposer finalizes the agreement and sends `Accept(Offer)` activity back to the interested party.

In the second case, the proposer sends `Reject(Offer)` activity. The interested party MAY send `Offer(Agreement)` activities many times until agreement is reached.

The representation of an agreement is a JSON document with the following properties:

- `id` (OPTIONAL): the unique global identifier of the agreement. This property is REQUIRED for finalized agreements.
- `type` (REQUIRED): the type of the object MUST be `Agreement`.
- `stipulates` (REQUIRED): the primary commitment associated with the agreement.
- `stipulatesReciprocal` (OPTIONAL): the reciprocal commitment associated with the agreement. It is REQUIRED if the corresponding proposal has a reciprocal intent.

**Commitments** are promised economic transactions. The representation of a commitment is a JSON document with the following properties:

  - `id` (OPTIONAL): the unique global identifier of the commitment. This property is REQUIRED for commitments in finalized agreements. Implementations SHOULD use URL fragments to identify commitments associated with a given agreement. The RECOMMENDED fragment identifiers for commitments satisfying primary and reciprocal intents of the proposal are `primary` and `reciprocal`.
  - `type` (REQUIRED): the type of the object MUST be `Commitment`.
  - `satisfies` (REQUIRED): the reference to an intent.
  - `resourceQuantity` (REQUIRED): the amount and unit of the economic resource.

The first commitment MUST satisfy the primary intent of the proposal. The second commitment MUST satisfy the reciprocal intent of the proposal (if present).

The units specified in the agreement MUST match the units specified in the proposal. If the value of `unitBased` property of the proposal is `false`, the amount of resources specified in commitments MUST be equal to amounts specified in the proposal. If the value is `true`, amounts MUST be multiples of amounts specified in the proposal. If `unitBased` property is not present on the proposal, arbitrary amounts can be used.

Example of an `Offer(Agreement)` activity:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {
      "om2": "http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/",
      "vf": "https://w3id.org/valueflows/ont/vf#",
      "Agreement": "vf:Agreement",
      "stipulates": "vf:stipulates",
      "stipulatesReciprocal": "vf:stipulatesReciprocal",
      "Commitment": "vf:Commitment",
      "satisfies": "vf:satisfies",
      "resourceQuantity": "vf:resourceQuantity",
      "hasUnit": "om2:hasUnit",
      "hasNumericalValue": "om2:hasNumericalValue"
    }
  ],
  "type": "Offer",
  "id": "https://social.example/objects/fc4af0d2-c3a1-409b-947c-3c5be29f49b0/offer",
  "actor": "https://social.example/users/bob",
  "object": {
    "type": "Agreement",
    "stipulates": {
      "type": "Commitment",
      "satisfies": "https://market.example/proposals/ddde9d6f-6f3b-4770-a966-3a18ef006930#primary",
      "resourceQuantity": {
        "hasUnit": "one",
        "hasNumericalValue": "1"
      }
    },
    "stipulatesReciprocal": {
      "type": "Commitment",
      "satisfies": "https://market.example/proposals/ddde9d6f-6f3b-4770-a966-3a18ef006930#reciprocal",
      "resourceQuantity": {
        "hasUnit": "one",
        "hasNumericalValue": "30"
      }
    }
  },
  "to": "https://market.example/users/alice"
}
```

### Accepting an agreement

The `object` of `Accept` activity MUST be the `id` of the `Offer` activity previously sent to the actor.

`Accept` activity MUST have the `result` property containing the `Agreement` object. The finalized agreement and corresponding commitments MUST have an `id` property. If a similar agreement between parties already exists, it MAY be updated and its `id` re-used. The quantities specified in the finalized agreement MUST match the quantities specified in `Agreement` object from the `Offer` activity.

The finalized agreement MAY have `url` property containing one or more links to resources associated with the agreement. An example of such resource is a payment page (which can be represented as an [FEP-0ea0] link).

Example:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {
      "om2": "http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/",
      "vf": "https://w3id.org/valueflows/ont/vf#",
      "Agreement": "vf:Agreement",
      "stiplulates": "vf:stiplulates",
      "stipulatesReciprocal": "vf:stipulatesReciprocal",
      "Commitment": "vf:Commitment",
      "satisfies": "vf:satisfies",
      "resourceQuantity": "vf:resourceQuantity",
      "hasUnit": "om2:hasUnit",
      "hasNumericalValue": "om2:hasNumericalValue"
    }
  ],
  "type": "Accept",
  "id": "https://market.example/activities/059f08fa-31b1-4136-8d76-5987d705a0ab",
  "actor": "https://market.example/users/alice",
  "object": "https://social.example/objects/fc4af0d2-c3a1-409b-947c-3c5be29f49b0/offer",
  "result": {
    "type": "Agreement",
    "id": "https://market.example/agreements/edc374aa-e580-4a58-9404-f3e8bf8556b2",
    "stiplulates": {
      "id": "https://market.example/agreements/edc374aa-e580-4a58-9404-f3e8bf8556b2#primary",
      "type": "Commitment",
      "satisfies": "https://market.example/proposals/ddde9d6f-6f3b-4770-a966-3a18ef006930#primary",
      "resourceQuantity": {
        "hasUnit": "one",
        "hasNumericalValue": "1"
      }
    },
    "stipulatesReciprocal": {
      "id": "https://market.example/agreements/edc374aa-e580-4a58-9404-f3e8bf8556b2#reciprocal",
      "type": "Commitment",
      "satisfies": "https://market.example/proposals/ddde9d6f-6f3b-4770-a966-3a18ef006930#reciprocal",
      "resourceQuantity": {
        "hasUnit": "one",
        "hasNumericalValue": "30"
      }
    },
    "url": {
      "type": "Link",
      "href": "https://pay.example/invoices/7f1f0c81-0108-4c91-9cb1-d38ebccc3aa1",
      "rel": "payment"
    }
  },
  "to": "https://social.example/users/bob"
}
```

### Rejecting an agreement

The `object` of `Reject` activity MUST be the `id` of the `Offer` activity previously sent to the actor.

Activity MAY contain `content` property indicating the reason for rejection.

Example:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Reject",
  "id": "https://market.example/activities/8c05f97f-1531-4b70-9ca8-4ee4a09f36a4",
  "actor": "https://market.example/users/alice",
  "object": "https://social.example/objects/fc4af0d2-c3a1-409b-947c-3c5be29f49b0/offer",
  "content": "Not available",
  "to": "https://social.example/users/bob"
}
```

## Confirmations

Economic transaction happens outside the protocol. When both parties complete their parts of the transaction, the proposing party MUST publish a confirmation.

The type and structure of confirmation activity may vary between different marketplaces, but it MUST contain a reference to the `Agreement` object. The `context` property is RECOMMENDED for this purpose.

Example:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams"
  ],
  "type": "Create",
  "id": "https://market.example/receipts/ad2f7ee1-6567-413e-a10b-72650cbdc743/create",
  "actor": "https://market.example/users/alice",
  "object": {
    "type": "Document",
    "id": "https://market.example/receipts/ad2f7ee1-6567-413e-a10b-72650cbdc743",
    "name": "Receipt",
    "context": "https://market.example/agreements/edc374aa-e580-4a58-9404-f3e8bf8556b2",
    "published": "2023-07-03T14:13:41.843794Z"
  },
  "to": "https://social.example/users/bob"
}
```
