      Actor's public key MUST be represented as an object with Multikey type, as defined in section 2.3.1.2 Multikey of Data Integrity specification. This object MUST have the following properties:

      id: the unique global identifier of the public key.
      type: the value of this property MUST contain the string Multikey.
      controller: the value of this property MUST match actor ID.
      publicKeyMultibase: a Multibase encoded value of a Multicodec prefix and the key. Implementations MUST use the base-58-btc alphabet.
      The Multikey object MAY contain the expires property indicating the expiration date of the key. Implementations MUST NOT not accept a signature created with a key that has been expired.
