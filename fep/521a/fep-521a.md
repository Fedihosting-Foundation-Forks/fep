# FEP-521a: Representing actor's public keys

## Summary

This proposal describes how to represent public keys associated with [ActivityPub] actors.

## Rationale

Historically, Fediverse services used [publicKey](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/security-vocab/#publicKey) property to represent actor's public key. Implementations usually allow only one key per actor, therefore a new approach is needed to support use cases where additional keys are required.

Furthermore, `publicKey` property was removed from the latest version of [Security Vocabulary][SecurityVocabulary].

## Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].

## Multikey

Each public key MUST be represented as an object with `Multikey` type, as defined in section *2.3.1.2 Multikey* of [Data Integrity](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity/#multikey) specification. This object MUST have the following properties:

- `id`: the unique global identifier of the public key.
- `type`: the value of this property MUST contain the string `Multikey`.
- `controller`: the value of this property MUST match actor ID.
- `publicKeyMultibase`: a [Multibase](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity/#multibase-0) encoded value of a [Multicodec] prefix and the key. Implementations MUST use the `base-58-btc` alphabet.

The `Multikey` object MAY contain the `expires` property indicating the expiration date of the key. Implementations MUST NOT not accept a signature created with a key that has been expired.

### Key IDs

Identifiers SHOULD be generated by appending a fragment identifier to the actor ID. Different public keys of the same actor MUST be identified using different fragment IDs.

Resolution of a URI containing a fragment identifier is performed in two steps:

1. Resolve URI without a fragment identifier.
2. Find a nested object where `id` (or `@id`) property contains the full URI.

### Key types

Implementers can use cryptographic keys of any type for which [Multicodec] prefix is registered.

## Controller document

`Multikey` objects MUST be added to the actor object, which is considered a controller document, as described in section *2.3 Controller Documents* of [Data Integrity](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-integrity/#controller-documents) specification.

If the key is intended to be used for signing ActivityPub objects, it MUST be added to the [`assertionMethod`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity/#assertion) array of the actor object.

Other use cases are currently out of scope of this proposal.

Implementations are discouraged from adding any objects to the `assertionMethod` array that does not conform to this specification. Implementations encountering non-conformant entries in the `assertionMethod` array SHOULD ignore them.

### Example

```json
{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
        "https://w3id.org/security/multikey/v1"
    ],
    "type": "Person",
    "id": "https://server.example/users/alice",
    "inbox": "https://server.example/users/alice/inbox",
    "outbox": "https://server.example/users/alice/outbox",
    "assertionMethod": [
        {
            "id": "https://server.example/users/alice#ed25519-key",
            "type": "Multikey",
            "controller": "https://server.example/users/alice",
            "publicKeyMultibase": "z6MkrJVnaZkeFzdQyMZu1cgjg7k1pZZ6pvBQ7XJPt4swbTQ2"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Difference between this proposal and FEP-c390

[FEP-c390](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/fep/c390/fep-c390.md) describes how to link external identities to ActivityPub actor. Valid identity proof implies that actor and proof's subject are controlled by the same entity.

This proposal describes how to represent actor's public keys. The corresponding private keys are controlled by the server.
