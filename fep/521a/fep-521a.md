# FEP-521a: Representing actor's public keys

## Summary

This proposal describes how to represent public keys associated with [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) actors.

## Rationale

Historically, Fediverse services used [publicKey](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/security-vocab/#publicKey) property to represent actor's public key. Implementations usually allow only one key per actor, therefore a new approach is needed to support use cases where additional keys are required.

## Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119.html).

## Multikey

Actor's key MUST be represented as an object with `Multikey` type and properties `id`, `controller` and `publicKeyMultibase`, as defined in section **2.1.1 Multikey** of [EdDSA Cryptosuite v2022](https://w3c.github.io/vc-di-eddsa/#multikey) specification.

The value of `controller` property MUST match actor ID.

### Key purpose

If key is intended to be used for authentication, it MUST be added to the `authentication` property of actor object. Other use cases are currently out of scope of this proposal.

### Example

```json
{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
        "https://w3id.org/security/data-integrity/v1",
        "https://w3id.org/security/multikey/v1"
    ],
    "type": "Person",
    "id": "https://server.example/users/alice",
    "inbox": "https://server.example/users/alice/inbox",
    "outbox": "https://server.example/users/alice/outbox",
    "authentication": [
        {
            "id": "https://server.example/users/alice#ed25519-key",
            "type": "Multikey",
            "controller": "https://server.example/users/alice",
            "publicKeyMultibase": "z6MkrJVnaZkeFzdQyMZu1cgjg7k1pZZ6pvBQ7XJPt4swbTQ2"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Difference between this proposal and FEP-c390

[FEP-c390](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/fep/c390/fep-c390.md) describes how to link external identities to ActivityPub actor. Valid identity proof implies that actor and proof's subject are controlled by the same entity.

This proposal describes how to represent actor's public keys. The corresponding private keys are controlled by the server.
