# Fediverse Enhancement Proposals

This is the Git repository containing Fediverse Enhancment Proposals (FEPs).

A Fediverse Enhancement Proposal (FEP) is a document that provides information to the Fediverse community. The goal of a FEP is to improve interoperability and well-being of diverse services, applications and communities that form the Fediverse.

The FEP Process is an initiative of the [SocialHub](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks) developer community, a liaison of the [W3C Social Web Incubator Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/SocialCG/). For ongoing and past discussion see the [SocialHub FEP category](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/c/standards/fep/54).

## Submitting a FEP

Do you have an idea, opinion or information that you want to share with the wider Fediverse community? You may do so with a Fediverse Enhancement Proposal (FEP).

To create and submit a FEP:

1. Fork this repository, and then clone it to your local machine. Check the Codeberg [Cheat sheet](https://docs.codeberg.org/collaborating/pull-requests-and-git-flow/#cheat-sheet) on how to prepare your Pull Request.
2. Think of a title for the FEP you want to submit.
3. Compute the identifier of the FEP by computing the hash of the title. This can be done with following Unix command:
```
$ echo -n "The title of my proposal" | sha256sum | cut -c-4
b3f0
```
4. Create a subdirectory of `fep/`(fep/) using the identifier you just computed. Copy the FEP template ([fep-xxxx-template.md](./fep-xxxx-template.md)) to this subdirectory and change the filename appropriately. Use the identifer as the "slug" when filling out the frontmatter. For example, if your computed identifier was `abcd`, then your file would be located at `fep/abcd/fep-abcd.md` and your frontmatter would include `slug: "abcd"`.
5. Write down your idea in the newly created file and commit it to a new branch in your repository (ex. fep-xxxx).
6. Create a Pull Request to complete Step 1 of [FEP-a4ed: The Fediverse Enhancement Proposal Process](./feps/fep-a4ed.md). Further process is described in FEP-a4ed.

## Editors

The list of FEP's is facilitated by Editors who are listed in the [EDITORS.md](EDITORS.md) file. Editors are neutral custodians of the FEP process, who merge PR's, create tracking issues, and start discussion threads for each FEP in the [SocialHub](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks) developer community forum.
