# FEP-8b32: Object Integrity Proofs

## Summary

This proposal describes how [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) servers and clients could create self-authenticating activities and objects.

HTTP signatures are often used for authentication during server-to-server interactions. However, this ties authentication to activity delivery, and limits the flexibility of the protocol.

Integrity proofs are sets of attributes that represent digital signatures and parameters required to verify them. These proofs can be added to any activity or object, allowing recipients to verify the identity of the actor and integrity of the data. That decouples authentication from the transport, and enables various protocol improvements such as activity relaying and nomadic identity.

## History

Mastodon implemented embedded signatures according to [Linked Data Signatures 1.0](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ld-signatures/) specification, which is now obsolete.

## Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119.html).

## Integrity proofs

The proposed authentication mechanism is based on [Data Integrity](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-integrity/) specification.

### Proof generation

The proof MUST be created according to the *Data Integrity* specification, section [4.1 Generate Proof](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-integrity/#generate-proof).

The process of proof generation consists of the following steps:

- **Canonicalization** is a transformation of a JSON object into the form suitable for hashing, according to some deterministic algorithm.
- **Hashing** is a process that calculates an identifier for the transformed data using a cryptographic hash function.
- **Signing** is a process that calculates a value that protects the integrity of the input data from modification.

The resulting proof is added to the original JSON object under the key `proof`. Objects MAY contain multiple proofs.

Example of unsigned activity:

```json
{
    "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    "type": "Create",
    "actor": "https://example.com/users/alice",
    "object": {
        "type": "Note",
        "content": "Hello world"
    }
}
```

Example of activity with integrity proof:

```json
{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
        "https://w3id.org/security/data-integrity/v1"
    ],
    "type": "Create",
    "actor": "https://example.com/users/alice",
    "object": {
        "type": "Note",
        "content": "Hello world"
    },
    "proof": {
        "type": "JcsRsaSignature2022",
        "created": "2022-11-12T00:00:00Z",
        "verificationMethod": "https://example.com/users/alice#main-key",
        "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
        "proofValue": "z2xZFiRJrr859BvmK22hS47448J..."
    }
}
```

The list of attributes used in integrity proof is defined in *Data Integrity* specification, section [2.1 Proofs](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-integrity/#proofs). The value of `verificationMethod` attribute SHOULD be an URL of actor's public key or a [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) associated with an actor.

### Proof verification

The recipient of activity SHOULD perform proof verification if it contains integrity proofs. Verification process MUST follow the *Data Integrity* specification, section [4.2 Verify Proof](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-integrity/#verify-proof). It starts with the removal of a `proof` value from the JSON object. Then the object is canonicalized, hashed and signature verification is performed according to the parameters specified in the proof.

If both HTTP signature and integrity proof are used, the integrity proof MUST be given precedence over HTTP signature. The HTTP signature MAY be dismissed.

### Algorithms

Implementors SHOULD pursue broad interoperability when choosing algorithms for integrity proofs. These algorithms are RECOMMENDED:

- Canonicalization: [JCS](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8785)
- Hashing: SHA-256
- Signatures: RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5

## Implementations

TBD
